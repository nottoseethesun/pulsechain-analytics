 * A known-bug test states what the code should do, in a check made of
 * assertions, and passes while the code still does the wrong thing, which
 * is while the check fails on one of its assertions. Once the code does the
 * right thing, the check passes and the test fails, saying so. That is the
 * cue to declare the test with `it` instead, in the same change as the fix,
 * so it then guards the fix. A check that fails with any other error fails
 * the test too, since the check then no longer tests the bug.
